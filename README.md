# Dev Help

The aim is to create a platform where , people who are willing to guide others and like to get guidance, can share a platform. Initial platform might include features like creating a profile and being able to share textual content in the feed of the followers and also being able to showcase and like each other's projects. A feedback can be given to any project and there would be an option to choose the anonymity of the feedback, anyone can further like/dislike the feedback. Many more features will be added subsequently as it grows.
